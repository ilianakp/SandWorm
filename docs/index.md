# Introduction

*__Sandworm, and its documentation, are a work in progress.__*

Sandworm is a [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com) plug-in that helps bridge between analog and digital modelling of landscapes. It enables an 'augmented reality sandbox' or 'tangible table' setup and ensures that this modelling environment is fast, feature-rich, customisable, and extensible.

## Download and Installation

A `gha` file and Yak package will be provided when Sandworm is officially released. Until then, Sandworm can be tested by downloading our repository and building the plugin using Visual Studio on Windows.

To use Sandworm you will need a copy of [Rhino 6](https://www.rhino3d.com), a [Kinect for Windows v2](https://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-on-windows/accessories/kinect-for-windows-v2-info) and have installed the [Kinect for Windows Runtime 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=44559).
