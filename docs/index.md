# Sandworm

Sandworm is a [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com) plug-in that helps bridge between analog and digital modelling of landscapes. It enables an 'augmented reality sandbox' or 'tangible table' setup and ensures that this modelling environment is fast, feature-rich, customisable, and extensible.

Sandworm supports the use of a [Kinect for Windows](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect/) or [Azure Kinect](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kinect-dk/).

## Download and Installation

Sandworm is available through [Rhino's Package Manager](https://www.rhino3d.com/features/package-manager/).

If using a Kinect for Windows, you will need to have installed the [Kinect for Windows Runtime 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=44559).
